## **What you did not do**

I did not really improve the visuals for the View Reports tab. I only added dark mode vs light mode differentiation.

## **What problems you encountered**

I had a tough time getting the videos to fit on an iPhone in the Learning Pages tab.

## **Use of AI and/or 3rd party software**

AI was mainly used to help fix the errors I got. It was also used for idea generation on what I could do to improve the visuals for each tab.

## **What you accomplished**

I was able to improve the visuals in some way for each tab in the app. For tabs like view reports and request, I only added the dark mode vs light mode differentiation. For the learning pages tab, I fixed the videos to fit within the borders of an iPhone, added the background to each video, and properly spaced the titles and descriptions for each video. For the contact us tab, I redesigned the visuals to make it look more clean and simple. I changed the email and call buttons, including their color and size. I also added the contact information part of the tab with the icons, email and phone number so that the user could get that information without having to actually email or call. For all tabs, I added the dark mode vs light mode differentiation so that when a user is in dark mode, the text is white and the background is black, and vice versa for light mode.
