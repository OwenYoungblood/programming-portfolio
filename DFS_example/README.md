# Graph Paths (DFS)

## Overview
Determines if paths exist between nodes in directed graphs based on input edges.

## Features
- Reads graph structure from standard input
- Uses depth-first search (DFS) to check path existence
- Reports results for multiple queries per graph

## Tech
- C++
- STL (stack, set, unordered_map)
