# Owen Youngblood â€” Software Engineering Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains my personal projects demonstrating algorithmic thinking, systems programming, and game/software development skills. 

## Projects Overview

### 1. Superball (C++)
- **Description:** Heuristic-based tile game engine, implementing scoring, swaps, and set analysis.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Algorithms, data structures (Disjoint Set Union), game logic, C++.
- **Folder:** `superball/`

### 2. Graph Paths / DFS (C++)
- **Description:** Determines whether paths exist in directed graphs based on standard input.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Graph traversal, recursion, DFS, algorithmic reasoning, C++.
- **Folder:** `dfs_graph_paths/`

### 3. Thread Pool (C)
- **Description:** POSIX thread pool implementation with job queue, synchronization, and concurrency control.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Multithreading, mutexes, condition variables, systems programming, C.
- **Folder:** `thread_pool/`

### 4. Binary Search Tree (C++)
- **Description:** Implementation of a BST with insertion, deletion, search, and traversal operations.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Classical data structures, recursion, algorithmic problem-solving, C++.
- **Folder:** `bst/`

### 5. RoofMRI App (React)
- **Description:** Near-complete iPhone app featuring the parts I worked on.
- **Skills Highlighted:** React, JavaScript, software engineering, mobile development.
- **Folder:** `RoofMRI/`

### 6. Hash Factor (C)
- **Description:** Factorizes large numbers using POSIX multiprocessing and inter-process communication (pipes, shared memory, message queues).
- **Skills Highlighted:** Fork/exec, IPC, process synchronization, parallel computation, C.
- **Folder:** `hash_factor/`
