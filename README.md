- **Repo/Folder:** `superball/`

### 2. Graph Paths / DFS (C++)
- **Description:** Determines whether paths exist in directed graphs based on standard input.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Graph traversal, recursion, DFS, algorithmic reasoning, C++.
- **Repo/Folder:** `dfs_graph_paths/`

### 3. Thread Pool (C++)
- **Description:** POSIX thread pool implementation with job queue, synchronization, and concurrency control.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Multithreading, mutexes, condition variables, systems programming, C++.
- **Repo/Folder:** `thread_pool/`

### 4. Binary Search Tree (C++)
- **Description:** Implementation of a BST with insertion, deletion, search, and traversal operations.
- **Skills Highlighted:** Classical data structures, recursion, algorithmic problem-solving, C++.
- **Repo/Folder:** `bst/`

### 5. iOS Game App (Swift)
- **Description:** Near-complete iPhone game app featuring core gameplay mechanics and interactive UI.
